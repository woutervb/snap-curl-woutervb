# snap-curl-woutervb
Curl snap under another namespace

This is a (hopefully) temporary repository to automatically build the curl snap, based on the release tags.
Builds are triggered / managed by the snapstore itself, so it should build for all available architectures, allowing the latest version of curl to be available.
